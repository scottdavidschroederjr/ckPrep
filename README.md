# ckPrep
A tool to help simplify prepping for battles in Crystal Kaizo Plus.

The basic idea is to build a site that fits with my standard notepad style formating that will save time manually typing in info for each fight as well make more complicated prep section (namely gauntlets) more straight forward.


- counter for fights remaining in split, section and gaunlet
- level cap view able based on where you're at
- togglable dark/light mode
- searchable bar for individual fights

Plan of attack
- hard code in selection of options of splits


Fight Info Outline
- trainer (name of trainer)
- splitNum (i.e. 2/10 how many fights left in the split)
- sectionNum (i.e 2/4 how many fights left in the location)
- gauntletNum (i.e. 5/10 in the gauntlet)
- notes (spikes, back to back, etc)
